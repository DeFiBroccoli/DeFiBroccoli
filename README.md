- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeFiBroccoli
- 👀 I’m interested in decentralised finance, maths, traditional finance and python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and more about decentralised options.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on crypto projects - but first I have to find my niche.
- 📫 How to reach me: @DefiBroccoli on twitter and DeFi Broccoli#5783 on dc - very new to the space, would love to make friends :)
